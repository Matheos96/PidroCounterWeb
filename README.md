# Pidro Counter Web 
*A PWA version of Pidro Counter made using React*

This progressive web application is up and running at: [pidrocounter.netlify.app](https://pidrocounterweb.netlify.app)

Pidro Counter is an app for Android which helps you keep track of your scores in the card game of Pidro. This is the web app version of that app, which is made using React, unlike the original which is made in Java. This version lacks a lot of features of the original, so if you do have an Android phone and think this app sounds useful, I would strongly recommend the play store app over this one. It is available for free with ads [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=esy.es.matmatt.PidroCounter) and for $0.99 without ads [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=esy.es.matmatt.PidroCounterPro).
